/**
 * Pulls buffered domain events from every {@see AggregateRoot} that
 * Doctrine just flushed and dispatches them through the default
 * Messenger bus.
 *
 * Why postFlush rather than onFlush: events emitted from a domain
 * method may need the persisted state (auto-generated ids, the row
 * actually being there for downstream queries) — Symfony's onFlush
 * fires before Doctrine commits, postFlush after. The trade-off is
 * we cannot abort the flush from a subscriber; subscribers that need
 * to fail loudly should throw and the unit-of-work catches it the
 * same way it would for any post-commit listener.
 *
 * UnitOfWork iteration:
 *   - identityMap holds every managed entity (insertions are already
 *     in there at postFlush). We walk it once and skip non-aggregates.
 *   - pullEvents() empties the buffer so a second flush in the same
 *     request does not replay the same events.
