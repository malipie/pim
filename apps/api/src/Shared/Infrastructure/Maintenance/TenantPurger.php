/**
 * AUD-019 / AUD-020 (W1-7) — irreversibly erases every row and storage
 * object that belongs to a single tenant, satisfying GDPR art. 17 (right
 * to erasure) for the hard-delete leg of tenant offboarding.
 *
 * Why ordered code-delete instead of FK CASCADE:
 *   24 of the 38 foreign keys pointing at `tenants` are ON DELETE RESTRICT
 *   (objects, object_values, users, assets, attributes, channels, the
 *   import_* / export_* clusters, …). They exist on purpose: a stray
 *   `DELETE FROM tenants` must NOT silently cascade through the whole
 *   catalogue. Re-pointing all 24 to CASCADE via migration would be a
 *   dangerous, hard-to-reverse weakening of that guard for every code path,
 *   not just offboarding. Instead we delete the dependent rows ourselves in
 *   strict child→parent order inside one transaction, then the tenant row.
 *   This is controlled, testable, idempotent and batched.
 *
 * RLS interaction (the subtle part):
 *   The runtime/CLI connects as `pim_app` (NOBYPASSRLS) and every
 *   tenant-scoped table has FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY. A plain `DELETE …
 *   WHERE tenant_id = :id` would therefore see ZERO rows (and silently
 *   delete nothing — a worse bug than the FK violation) unless the session
 *   GUC `app.current_tenant` is set to the tenant being purged. {@see purge}
 *   sets it for the duration of the delete and resets it in a finally, so
 *   the operation is scoped to exactly one tenant at the DB layer — the
 *   `demo` / `acme` tenants are physically invisible to these statements.
 *   The explicit `WHERE tenant_id = :id` predicate is defence in depth on
 *   top of RLS. Under the test schema (built from ORM metadata, no RLS
 *   policies) the GUC is a harmless no-op and the WHERE clause is the only
 *   guard — which is exactly what the offboarding test asserts.
 *
 * Memory (FrankenPHP worker mode, §3.10): deletes go through the DBAL
 * connection as set-based SQL (no entity hydration, no Identity Map growth),
 * so no per-row `clear()` is needed; the largest tenant's `object_values`
 * delete is a single server-side statement.
 *
 * Storage cascade: every Asset / export / import-upload object lives under
 * the `<tenant-uuid>/` path prefix (flysystem.yaml). After the DB rows are
 * gone we `deleteDirectory(<tenant-uuid>)` on each of the three named
 * operators. Storage failure is logged at error level and rethrown by
 * default so the caller never reports a clean purge while PII blobs linger;
 * see {@see purge} ordering note.

    /**
     * Child→parent delete order across every tenant-scoped table. Each row
     * is `[table, tenantColumn]`. The order is a topological sort of the
     * inter-table foreign keys so a child is always gone before its parent:
     *
     *   1. import_* / export_* / channel_* leaf rows (logs, runs, sessions,
     *      placements, category nodes) before their profiles/schedules.
     *   2. object_values / object_relations / saved_views / bulk_edit_jobs
     *      before objects.
     *   3. objects before object_types and before bulk_sessions
     *      (objects → bulk_sessions / import_sessions is ON DELETE SET NULL,
     *      so objects must precede them to avoid dangling set-nulls; but
     *      semantically the children are purged first anyway).
     *   4. attribute_options before attributes before attribute_groups.
     *   5. channels / assets / api_* / backups (their children already gone).
     *   6. identity: invitations (RESTRICT → users/roles) before the
     *      user-scoped tokens, before users.
     *
     * Tables whose FK to `tenants` is already ON DELETE CASCADE (roles,
     * sso_providers, tenant_locales, menu_configurations,
     * tenant_agent_configs, channel_publication_profiles, refresh_tokens via
     * users, …) are STILL listed and deleted explicitly: relying on the
     * final `DELETE FROM tenants` cascade would make the row counts the
     * offboarding test asserts depend on cascade side effects, and leaves
     * orphan-prone tables (bulk_sessions, bulk_edit_jobs, smart_filter_presets,
     * refresh_tokens, saved_views) — which carry `tenant_id` but NO FK to
     * tenants — behind forever. Explicit is safer and idempotent.
