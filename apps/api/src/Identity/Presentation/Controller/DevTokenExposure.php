/**
 * AUD-007 (#1577) — environment guard for the dev-only magic-link /
 * password-reset plaintext token.
 *
 * Until the production email send fully replaces the in-response token,
 * the password-reset + invitation endpoints expose the freshly minted
 * 256-bit plaintext token in their JSON body so the operator can drive
 * the confirm/accept flow without a mailbox. That convenience is a
 * CRITICAL account-takeover vector on any prod deploy: the endpoints are
 * PUBLIC_ACCESS, so knowing a victim's email is enough to mint + read a
 * working reset token.
 *
 * This trait gates the field on the kernel environment. Consuming
 * controllers take the environment as a constructor argument (bound to
 * `%kernel.environment%` in services.yaml) so the guard is unit-testable
 * without booting a prod kernel: in `prod` the field is omitted entirely
 * (not nulled — the key must be absent so no contract reader treats it as
 * present-but-empty); in dev/test it is returned verbatim, preserving the
 * existing operator workflow.
