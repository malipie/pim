/**
 * RBAC-P3-011 (#674) — per-workflow-state edit policy aligned with the
 * PRD §3.8 (forward-spec) role × state matrix.
 *
 * CatalogObject ships three statuses today (`draft`, `published`,
 * `archived`) — the `review` state mentioned in the ticket prospectively
 * lands with a dedicated Symfony Workflow definition later (epic 0.6
 * or follow-up). The policy maps onto the current three:
 *
 *   - **draft**       — editable by every role that holds
 *                       `products.edit` (Owner / Admin / Catalog Manager
 *                       / Marketing / Channel Manager per macierz),
 *   - **published**   — editable only by roles holding
 *                       `workflow.edit_any_state` (Owner / Admin per
 *                       PrdRoleTemplates). Anyone else needs the
 *                       *auto-unpublish* path: caller posts
 *                       `?auto_unpublish=true`, the policy reports
 *                       `requiresAutoUnpublish()=true`, and the controller
 *                       atomically transitions published → draft + edit +
 *                       audit_log special_flag `AUTO_UNPUBLISH_FOR_EDIT`,
 *   - **archived**    — locked, no edits in MVP (archived state is the
 *                       "soft-deleted" terminal status; restoration goes
 *                       through a separate transition endpoint).
 *
 * The policy returns booleans only — the actual auto-transition
 * (state mutation + atomic edit + audit entry) is the controller /
 * Symfony Workflow's responsibility once it lands. This keeps the
 * authorization layer free of side effects.
 *
 * Auto-transition permission code (`workflow.transition.unpublish`) is
 * not yet seeded in `PrdRoleTemplates` — the policy short-circuits to
 * `false` until the seeder adds it, so the auto-unpublish path is
 * effectively dormant until the macierz catches up. A focused
 * follow-up adds the code + UI toggle.
