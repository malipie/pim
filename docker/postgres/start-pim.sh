# Custom entrypoint wrapper for the PIM database image.
#
# Responsibilities (in order):
#   1. Register the postgres crontab via `crontab -u` and launch dcron in the
#      background so the production schedule (full/diff + weekly restore-test)
#      runs pgBackRest under the postgres user.
#   2. Launch pim-init-backup.sh in the background. It waits until postgres is
#      accepting connections, then idempotently creates the stanza and triggers
#      an initial full backup. Backgrounded so it never blocks postgres start-up.
#   3. Hand control over to the upstream `docker-entrypoint.sh postgres ...`
#      which performs initdb on first run and then exec's postgres.

# AUD-017: dcron (dillon's cron 4.5) only loads a per-user crontab once it has
# been (re)registered through `crontab -u` — a file dropped straight into
# /etc/crontabs by the Dockerfile is synchronised for `root` but silently
# ignored for every other user, so the postgres schedule never fired and the
# backup cron was dead for ~49 days (the repo kept only the 2026-04-28 full).
# Re-install it from the baked-in source on every boot so dcron picks it up on
# a fresh volume AND a pre-existing one. Idempotent: same content each time.
